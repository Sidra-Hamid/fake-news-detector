# fake-news-detector
This Python-based machine learning project detects fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It classifies news articles as either fake or genuine based on textual features extracted from a curated dataset.

Features:
- Dataset: Utilizes a dataset of labeled news articles (Fake.csv and True.csv) for training and evaluation.
- Text Processing: Preprocesses text data using tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and feature engineering.
- Classification Model: Implements a machine learning classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict fake news.
- Evaluation Metrics: Computes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
